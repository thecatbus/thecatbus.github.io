Hello! I am <b>Parth Shimpi</b>, a PhD student in mathematics and a member of <a href="https://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/core/Welcome">Core Structures @ Glasgow</a> which encompasses researchers at the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk">University of Glasgow</a> working on Algebra, Analysis, Number theory, and Geometry & Topology.  
You can read more about me <a href="./about.html">here</a>.

<p>I did Part III in 2022, doing courses on algebra and geometry. The lecture notes for these can be found <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjrujelXofEXgR0CLEmkabiw5cpY?e=jfwYlZ">here</a>. Alejandro Epelde Blanco took many of the same courses and maintains his notes <a href="https://ae433.user.srcf.net/cambridge-notes/">here</a>.</p>
