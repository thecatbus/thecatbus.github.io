<p>One of the first tools one encounters in the study of homotopy groups is to consider covering spaces– things that <em>locally</em> look like products with some discrete topological space <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> but can have vastly different global properties than a simple product space. In fact the number of non-trivial covering spaces is a measure of the topological complexity of the space, in a sense made precise by the Galois correspondence of fundamental groups. It is then natural to ask what happens if one replaces <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> with more a complicated topological space <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>: what results is a richer analogue of a covering space called a <em>fiber bundle</em>, or a <em>vector bundle</em> if <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a vector space.</p>

<p>Recall that we say <span class="math inline">\(E\xrightarrow{p} B\)</span> is a <em>covering space</em> with fibers <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a discrete topological space) if <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has an open cover <span class="math inline">\(\{U_\alpha\}\)</span> such that for each <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, there is a homeomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\phi_\alpha: U_\alpha \times F \rightarrow p^{-1}(U_\alpha)\)</span> which makes the following diagram commute (here <span class="math inline">\(\pi_i\)</span> can <em>any</em> of the projection maps which the product comes with.)</p>

</center>
This motivates the definition of a vector bundle:
<div class="definition">
<p><sc>Definition</sc> For a topological space <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, we say <span class="math inline">\(E\xrightarrow{p} B\)</span> is a (real) <em>vector bundle</em> of rank <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has an open cover <span class="math inline">\(\{U_\alpha\}\)</span> such that for each <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, we have a fiber-preserving homeomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\phi_\alpha: U_\alpha\times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow p^{-1}(U_\alpha)\)</span> which is a linear isomorphism on each fiber (i.e. for each <span class="math inline">\(x\in U_\alpha\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\phi_\alpha\)</span> restricts to a linear isomorphism <span class="math inline">\(x\times \mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow p^{-1}(x)\)</span> of affine spaces).</p>
<p>Vector bundles of rank <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> are termed <em>line bundles</em>.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is termed the <em>total space</em>, while <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the <em>base space</em>. The collection of charts <span class="math inline">\(\{(\phi_\alpha, U_\alpha)\}\)</span> is called a <em>trivialization</em>.</p>
<p>Note that one may replace <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> with any other field, and strengthen ‘homeomorphism’ in the above definition to ‘diffeomorphism’ or ‘isomorphism’ depending on what kind of geometry is involved.</p>
<p>The condition we ask for is <em>local trivialization</em>: to each <span class="math inline">\(U_\alpha\)</span>, the map <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> must look just like a projection <span class="math inline">\(U_\alpha \times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow U_\alpha\)</span>. As with covering spaces, this says nothing about the global structure that <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> might possess. <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> has carrier set <span class="math inline">\(\coprod_{x\in B} \{x\}\times \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p:E\rightarrow B\)</span> acts as the natural map on sets, but <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> has additional structure induced by both the topology on <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and the vector space structure on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. The vector bundle then is a <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>-parametrised family of vector spaces which varies ‘smoothly’.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><sc>Example</sc> What is the simplest thing that locally looks like a product? A product, of course. Accordingly, we call <span class="math inline">\(E= B\times \mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow B\)</span> the <em>trivial bundle</em> of rank <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Note that a bundle is trivial if and only if <span class="math inline">\(\{(\text{id}, B)\}\)</span> is a trivialization.</p>
<p>A slightly more involved example is that of a <em>tangent bundle</em>: given an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional differentiable manifold <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, to each <span class="math inline">\(x\in B\)</span> we can associate the tangent space <span class="math inline">\(T_xB\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\cong \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>). Then the tangent bundle has carrier set <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
E&amp;=\coprod_{x\in B} \{x\}\times T_xB \\ 
&amp;= \{(x,y)\;|\;x\in B, \; y\in T_xB\}
\end{align*}\]</span> and there is a natural map <span class="math inline">\(p: E\rightarrow B\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\mapsto x\)</span>. We can turn this into a vector bundle– in fact, a manifold in its own right. Recall that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has an open cover <span class="math inline">\(\{U_\alpha\}\)</span> such that each <span class="math inline">\(U_\alpha\)</span> is diffeomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> via some chart <span class="math inline">\(\theta_\alpha\)</span>. Identifying each <span class="math inline">\(T_xB\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, we can define functions (of sets) <span class="math inline">\(\phi_\alpha: U_\alpha \times \mathbb{R}^n \cong \mathbb{R}^{2n}\rightarrow p^{-1}(U_\alpha)\)</span>. Giving <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> the weak topology induced by these, we have an atlas of charts on <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> whose transition functions can be checked to be smooth. Then in addition to being a vector bundle, <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is also a <span class="math inline">\(2n\)</span>-dimensional manifold.</p>
<p>What does the tangent bundle of <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> look like? If <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\in S^1\)</span>, we have that <span class="math inline">\(T_{(x,y)}S^1 = \{(u,v)\;|\; ux+vy=0\}\subset \mathbb{R}^2\)</span> hence the tangent bundle <span class="math inline">\(TS^1\)</span> is precisely the manifold <span class="math inline">\(\{(x,y,u,v)\;|\;x^2+y^2=1, \; ux+vy=0\}\subset \mathbb{R}^4\)</span>, isomorphic to the annulus <span class="math inline">\(\{(x,y,u)\;|\;x^2+y^2=1\}\subset \mathbb{R}^3\)</span>. But this is the trivial bundle <span class="math inline">\(S^1\times \mathbb{R}\)</span>.</p>
<p>What about other spheres? It is a fact that <span class="math inline">\(S^1, S^3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S^7\)</span> are the only spheres whose tangent bundle is trivial. We will be able to address the case for <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span> once we understand what <em>sections</em> are.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="linearity">Linearity</h2>
<p>In the definition of a vector bundle we insist that the charts are linear isomorphisms on fibers, not just diffeomorphisms. This is a strong constraint, but also a helpful one since vector spaces are rich with structure and we understand them well. Firstly, observe that associating a vector space to each point is morally the right thing to do when dealing with objects like tangent bundles of a manifold. And all our favourite vector space operations extend directly to vector bundles– in essence, all operations are ‘pointwise’:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Direct sums</strong>: If <span class="math inline">\(E_1\xrightarrow{p_1}B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_2\xrightarrow{p_2}B\)</span> are two vector bundles on <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(E_1\oplus E_2\)</span> has carrier set <span class="math inline">\(\{(v_1,v_2)\;|\; p_1(v_1)=p_2(v_2)\}\)</span> and associated projection <span class="math inline">\(p(v_1,v_2)=p_1(v_1)=p_2(v_2)\)</span>. After checking local triviality, we can see that this does what we want: for any <span class="math inline">\(x\in B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p^{-1}(x)=p_1^{-1}(x)\oplus p_2^{-1}(x)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tensor products</strong>: For <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> as above, we define <span class="math inline">\(E_1\otimes E_2\)</span> to have carrier set the disjoint union of <span class="math inline">\(p_1^{-1}(x)\otimes p_2^{-1}(x)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x\in B\)</span>, and the natural projection map. The topology is given by taking open sets which trivialize both <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>, and then letting the fiberwise tensor products of the charts on these be homeomorphisms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Linear Duals</strong>: If <span class="math inline">\(E\xrightarrow{p}B\)</span> is a vector bundle, then we can define the <em>dual bundle</em> <span class="math inline">\(E^\ast\)</span> to have carrier set given by the disjoint union of <span class="math inline">\(p^{-1}(x)^\ast\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(x\in B\)</span>. This can be given a topology by explicitly gluing the pullbacks of open sets along transition functions, a method of construction we shall meet next.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="twisted-functions">Twisted functions</h1>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(f:X\rightarrow Y\)</span> is a morphism, we can replace it with a morphism <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}: X\rightarrow X\times Y\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}(x)=(x,f(y))\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}\)</span> thus given is called the <em>graph</em> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Moreover, the correspondence is one-to-one in that if <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}:X\rightarrow X\times Y\)</span> is any morphism such that <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1\circ \tilde{f}=\text{id}_X\)</span>, then there is a unique morphism <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> which <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}\)</span> is the graph of.</p>
<p>Now suppose <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is a topological space, and <span class="math inline">\(\{U_\alpha\}\)</span> is an open cover of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(f:B\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> is any continuous map, then its graph <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}\)</span> is a map from <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to the trivial vector bundle <span class="math inline">\(B\times \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> satisfying <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}\circ \pi_1 = \text{id}_B\)</span>. In a trivial way, it induces maps <span class="math inline">\(U_\alpha\rightarrow U_\alpha\times \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> which when ‘stitched’ together, give a map <span class="math inline">\(B\rightarrow B\times \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. Then a function <span class="math inline">\(f: B\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> is what we get by ‘stitching’ <em>locally defined</em> functions into a global function. We can generalise this construction by not restricting ourselves to trivial stitching.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><sc>Definition</sc> If <span class="math inline">\(E\xrightarrow{p} B\)</span> is a vector bundle, we say <span class="math inline">\(f:B\rightarrow E\)</span> is a <em>section</em> if <span class="math inline">\(p\circ f=\text{id}_B\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>A particularly nice one is the <em>zero section</em>, which assigns to each <span class="math inline">\(x\in B\)</span> the point <span class="math inline">\((x,0)\in E\)</span>. Since vector bundle isomorphisms act like linear isomorphisms on fibres, zero sections are preserved.</p>
<p>Since vector bundles are locally trivial, the restrictions of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to trivialising open sets are functions. It is immediate from the preceding discussion that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>-valued functions are precisely sections of the trivial bundle of rank <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><sc>Example</sc> The space <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{RP}^n\)</span> is defined as the space of lines of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\)</span> through the origin. Assigning to every ‘point’ of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{RP}^n\)</span> the line that it actually is gives us the <em>tautological bundle</em> <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, whose carrier set is <span class="math inline">\(\{(\ell,v)\;|\; \ell \in \mathbb{RP}^n, v\in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}, v\in \ell\}\)</span>. The simplest case is obtained for <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span>, when <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{RP}^1\)</span> is homeomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{S}^1\)</span>. The tautological bundle <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> in this case is called the <em>Mobius bundle</em>, since it is homeomorphic to the interior of a Mobius strip: <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{RP}^1\cong[0,\pi]/\{0,\pi\}\)</span> is swept by a line rotating through <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\{0\}\times\mathbb{R}\)</span> identified with <span class="math inline">\(\{\pi\}\times \mathbb{R}\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\((0,t)\sim (\pi,-t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>What do sections of the Mobius bundle look like? We can trivialise <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> by taking charts <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{RP}^n \setminus \{x\} \cong (0,1)\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>– then the restriction of any section <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to this chart gives a function <span class="math inline">\(g:(0,1)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}g(x)=-\lim_{x\rightarrow 1} g(x)\)</span>. This is a family of partial functions on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{RP}^n\)</span> that carries the same information up to some transition function: it is morally the right thing to put them together into one packet. However, there is no total function that does the job since restrictions of total functions on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{RP}^n (\cong S^1)\)</span> to the chosen charts agree at end points. The construction we need is precisely that of a Mobius bundle, and the sections of this bundle are the ‘twisted function’ we want.</p>
<p>Then is the Mobius bundle isomorphic to the trivial bundle on <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span>? No: a simple way to see this is that every section on the Mobius bundle must meet the zero section at some point (think intermediate value theorem) while the trivial bundle has a nowhere-vanishing section.</p>
</div>
<p>We will now make precise the idea of gluing these partial functions with appropriate twists involved.</p>
<h2 id="transition-functions-and-structure-groups">Transition functions and structure groups</h2>
<p>What does it mean to ‘stitch’ these partial functions? If <span class="math inline">\(\{U_\alpha\}\)</span> is the trivializing cover of the vector bundle <span class="math inline">\(E\xrightarrow{p}B\)</span>, then for any <span class="math inline">\(\alpha,\beta\)</span> writing <span class="math inline">\(U_{\alpha\beta}=U_\alpha\cap U_\beta\)</span> we see that <span class="math inline">\(p^{-1}(U_{\alpha\beta})\)</span> sits inside both <span class="math inline">\(\phi_\alpha(U_\alpha\times \mathbb{R}^n)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi_\beta(U_\beta\times \mathbb{R}^n)\)</span>. Identifying these copies gives us a map <span class="math inline">\(\phi_\alpha \circ \phi_\beta^{-1}:U_{\alpha\beta}\times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow U_{\alpha\beta}\times \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> that is an automorphism of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> on each fiber (i.e. for each fixed <span class="math inline">\(x\in U_{\alpha\beta}\)</span>). In other words, for each <span class="math inline">\(x\in U_{\alpha\beta}\)</span> we have a linear map <span class="math inline">\(g_{\alpha\beta}(x)\in GL_n(\mathbb{R})\)</span>. We can check that these maps satisfy the <em>cocycle condition</em>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{gather*}
g_{\alpha\alpha}=\text{id} \\
g_{\alpha\beta}\cdot g_{\beta\gamma}=g_{\alpha\gamma}
\end{gather*}\]</span></p>
<p>This method of using explicit transition functions can be used to construct new vector bundles from scratch: given <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> with a collection of charts <span class="math inline">\(U_\alpha\)</span> and functions <span class="math inline">\(g_{\alpha\beta}:U_{\alpha}\cap U_\beta \rightarrow GL_n(\mathbb{R})\)</span> which satisfy the cocycle conditions, there is a fiber bundle <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> that is trivializable over <span class="math inline">\(\{U_\alpha\}\)</span> with transition functions <span class="math inline">\(g_{ij}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now it may happen that the maps <span class="math inline">\(\{g_{\alpha\beta}\}\)</span> take values in a subgroup <span class="math inline">\(G\subset GL_n(\mathbb{R})\)</span>, which then captures the symmetries of how the different charts overlap. This group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is then called a <em>structure group</em> and the charts <span class="math inline">\(\{U_\alpha\}\)</span> define a <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-<em>structure</em> on the vector bundle <span class="math inline">\(E\rightarrow B\)</span>. While the cocycles <span class="math inline">\(\{g_{\alpha\beta}\}\)</span> depend on the choice of trivialization, structure groups are an invariant of the bundle.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<sc>Proposition</sc> For a smooth manifold <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, the vector bundle <span class="math inline">\(E\rightarrow B\)</span> is trivial if and only if it has a trivial structure group.
</div>
<div class="proof">
<sc>Proof</sc> Suppose <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is the trivial bundle of rank <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\{(\text{id}, B)\}\)</span> is a trivialization with cocycles <span class="math inline">\(\{\text{id}\}\subset GLn(\mathbb{R})\)</span>. Conversely, suppose <span class="math inline">\(E\rightarrow B\)</span> is a vector bundle with trivial structure-group, and <span class="math inline">\(\{(\phi_\alpha,U_\alpha)\}\)</span> is a choice of trivialization. Then for any <span class="math inline">\(\alpha,\beta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\phi_\alpha\circ \phi_{\beta}^{-1}\)</span> is the identity on <span class="math inline">\(\{x\} \times \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(x\in U_\alpha\cap U_\beta\)</span>, so in fact <span class="math inline">\(\phi_\alpha^{-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi_\beta^{-1}\)</span> agree on <span class="math inline">\(p^{-1}(U_\alpha)\cap p^{-1}(U_\beta)\)</span>. Then by the gluing lemma for smooth maps [CITATION NEEDED] we find a smooth map <span class="math inline">\(\phi^{-1}: \bigcup_\alpha p^{-1}(U_\alpha) = E \rightarrow E\times \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> that we can check is a diffeomorphism. <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span>
</div>
<p>What is the structure group of the Mobius bundle <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(S^1= [0,1]/\{0,1\}\)</span>? We can triviale the bundle as <span class="math inline">\(\{(\phi_0, U_0), (\phi_1,U_1\})\}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(U_0 = S^1\setminus\{0\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U_1=S^1\setminus\{\frac{1}{2}\}\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(U_0\cap U_1=(0,\frac{1}{2})\cap (\frac{1}{2}, 1)\)</span>, so the transition function is <span class="math display">\[g_{01}(x): t\mapsto \begin{cases} t, &amp;x&lt;\frac{1}{2} \\ -t, &amp;x&gt;\frac{1}{2}.\end{cases}\]</span> The structure group can be seen to be <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\cong O(1)\subset GL_1(\mathbb{R})\)</span>. In particular, the Mobius bundle is non-trivial.</p>
<p>Note that the structure group of the Mobius bundle contains elements of negative determinant– this corresponds to the transition function reversing the orientation of the fibers when gluing. Accordingly, vector bundles who have a structure group with only elements of positive determinant are termed <em>orientable</em>. Hence the Mobius bundle is non-orientable.</p>
<h2 id="vector-fields">Vector fields</h2>
<p>This idea of writing functions as sections provides a useful tool when you naturally care about maps whose codomain depends on the argument– for instance, a vector field <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> on a smooth manifold <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> which continuously assigns to each <span class="math inline">\(x\in B\)</span> a vector <span class="math inline">\(v(x)\in T_xB\)</span>. While using classical terminology would <em>require</em> us to consider an embedding of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> in a larger affine space, we can now define vector fields as sections of the tangent bundle <span class="math inline">\(TB\)</span>. While there are ways to embed the manifold with its tangent bundles in a larger space to avoid variable codomains, the tool becomes indispensible when considering <em>cotangent bundles</em> (the linear dual to the tangent bundle), where a section <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> gives, for each <span class="math inline">\(x\in B\)</span>, a linear functional <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\in (T_xB)^\ast\)</span>.</p>
<p>The additional linear structure that vector bundles contain over fiber bundles gives us a lot more to talk about. For instance, we say a collection of vector fields <span class="math inline">\(\{V_\alpha\}\)</span> on smooth manifold <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is <em>linearly independent</em> if <span class="math inline">\(\{V_\alpha(x)\}\)</span> is a linearly independent subset of <span class="math inline">\(T_xB\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(x\in B\)</span>. The vector fields form a <em>basis</em> of the tangent bundle if the corresponding vectors at each point form a basis of the tangent space. Then if an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> dimensional manifold has a basis of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vector fields, we can decompose the tangent bundle into linear combinations of these fields and construct an isomorphism with the trivial bundle. These definitions and results are true for general vector bundles:</p>
<div class="theorem">
<sc>Theorem</sc> If <span class="math inline">\(E\xrightarrow{p}B\)</span> is a vector bundle of rank <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is trivial if and only if it admits a basis of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> sections.
</div>
<p>This, for instance, immediately shows that the tangent bundle of <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> is trivial since there is a non-vanishing vector field on <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span>. On the other hand, the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem">hairy ball theorem</a></em> asserts that even dimensional spheres admit no nowhere-vanishing continuous vector fields– in particular, there cannot be a basis of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vector fields hence the tangent bundles are nontrivial. In a similar vein, the fact that the Mobius bundle has no non-vanishing sections (a fact that follows from the intermediate value theorem) shows that it is a non-trivial bundle.</p>
<p>To conclude, we shall give a construction of ‘twisted functions’ that naturally arises in algebraic geometry.</p>

Up to composition with the transition function <span class="math inline">\(g_{01}=\frac{X_1}{X_0}\)</span>, these are the same function on a point in <span class="math inline">\(U_0\cap U_1\)</span>, which is to say the two pieces carry the same data. It is natural to want to put the two together, and the construction that works is to consider the homogeneous polynomial <span class="math inline">\(X_0+X_1\)</span>. This is a construction that, on each patch gives an honest function i.e. a section of the line bundle <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{A}^n\times \mathbb{C}\)</span>. It is, however, not a section of the trivial line bundle since it is not a function.</p>
<p>Recall that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^n\)</span> is the space of all (complex) ‘lines’ through the origin in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}^{n+1}\)</span>, so has an associated tautological line bundle which we call <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(-1)\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^n\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(1)\xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{P}^n\)</span> denote the linear dual of this bundle, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(p^{-1}(x_0:...:x_n)\)</span> is the space of linear functionals on <span class="math inline">\((x_0,...,x_n)\mathbb{C}\subset \mathbb{C}^{n+1}\)</span>. This carries the structure of a quasi-projective variety: writing <span class="math inline">\((X_0:...:X_{n+1})\)</span> for the homogeneous coordinates on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^{n+1}\)</span>, we note that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^n\)</span> is the variety <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{V}(X_{n+1})\)</span>. Consider the quasi-projective variety given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*} 
V &amp;= \mathbb{P}^{n+1}\setminus\{(0:...:0:1)\} \\
&amp;= \{(x_0:...:x_n:\lambda)\;|\; (x_0:...:x_n)\in \mathbb{P}^n, \; \lambda \in \mathbb{C}\}.
\end{align*}\]</span> Then we can give a bijection <span class="math inline">\(V\rightarrow \mathcal{O}(1)\)</span> by mapping <span class="math inline">\((x_0:...:x_n:\lambda)\)</span> to the linear map <span class="math inline">\((x_0,...,x_n)\mapsto \lambda\)</span>. Henceforth we shall use the two realisations of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(1)\)</span> interchangeably.</p>
<p>Equipped with the natural projection map <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, we can explicitly show that this is a (complex) line bundle over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^n\)</span> trivialized by the affine patches: on <span class="math inline">\(U_0\)</span> we have the holomorphic chart <span class="math inline">\((1:x_1:...:x_n:\lambda)\mapsto ((1:x_1:x_2:...:x_n), \lambda)\subset \mathbb{P}^n\times \mathbb{C}\)</span> and for a fixed <span class="math inline">\((x_0:...:x_n)\in U_i\cap U_j\)</span>, the transition function between fibres is multiplication by <span class="math inline">\(\frac{x_i}{x_j}\)</span> (a well-defined non-zero finite number), a linear isometry.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(f\in \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}\)</span> is any homogeneous polynomial of degree <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> corresponds to the section <span class="math inline">\(z\mapsto (z:f(z))\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(1)\subset \mathbb{P}^{n+1}\)</span> (the degree <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> condition ensures this section is well-defined). Considering <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(1)\)</span> as the dual to the tautological line bundle, if <span class="math inline">\(f(X_0,...,X_n)=\sum a_iX_i\)</span> then it determines the section such that <span class="math inline">\(F(x_0:...:x_n)=f|_{(x_0,...,x_n)\mathbb{C}}\)</span> (check that this is indeed a linear functional on <span class="math inline">\((x_0,...,x_n)\mathbb{C}\)</span>.)</p>
<p>On the other hand if <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a holomorphic section of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(1)=\mathcal{O}(-1)^\ast\)</span>, then for each <span class="math inline">\((x_0:...:x_n)\in \mathbb{P}^1\)</span> we can extract from <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> a <span class="math inline">\(F(x_0,...,x_n)\in\mathbb{C}\)</span>, the image of <span class="math inline">\((x_0,...,x_n)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(f(x_0:...:x_n)\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a well-defined holomorphic function <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}^{n+1}\setminus \{0\} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}\)</span>. From the description it is clear that <span class="math inline">\(F(\lambda x_0,...,\lambda x_n) = \lambda F(x_0,...,x_n)\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is in fact linear and homogeneous. In particular, the singularity at <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is removable, and we have a homogeneous polynomial of degree <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Thus linear homogeneous polynomials are precisely sections of the hyperplane bundles <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(1)\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Writing <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(k)=\mathcal{O}(1)^{\otimes k}\)</span>, sections of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(k)\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^n\)</span> would correspond to formal products of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> sections of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(1)\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^n\)</span> which we expect are degree <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> homogeneous polynomials. That is indeed what happens, and all homogeneous polynomials on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^n\)</span> can be obtained in this way.</p>

<p>Going back to the initial motivation, we study covering spaces because the isomorphism classes of covering spaces on a space are a measure of its complexity (roughly the same measure as the fundamental group). We can play similar games with vector bundles.</p>
<p>Observe that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\setminus \{0\}\)</span> is homotopy equivalent to the discrete two-point space <span class="math inline">\(S^0\)</span>, so if <span class="math inline">\(E\rightarrow B\)</span> is a real line bundle with zero-section <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(E\setminus Z\)</span> has the homotopy type of a fiber bundle with fibers <span class="math inline">\(S^0\)</span> i.e. a double-cover of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. It is an easy check that the trivial line bundle gives the trivial double cover (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(B\times S^0\)</span>). This gives us another way to see that the Mobius bundle is non-trivial: removing the zero-section leaves us with (up to homotopy) the non-trivial double-cover of <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Just like covering spaces, the classes of vector bundles on a compact Hausdorff base space is a homotopy invariant. In particular, we have the following result</p>
<div class="theorem">
<sc>Theorem</sc> Every vector bundle over a contractible compact Hausdorff space is trivial.
</div>
<p>Of course, the whole article was an elaborate proof of the fact that <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> is not contractible.</p>
