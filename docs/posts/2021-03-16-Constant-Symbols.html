        <p>We define the signature of a first-order language as a collection of symbols for functions, predicates and <em>constants</em>. Does removing any of them make the language less expressive? Here we look at an example that shows constant-symbols (or some equivalent) are necessary to express certain properties. <!--more--></p>
<p>The theory of groups is usually written in the signature <span class="math inline">\(\{\ast,e\}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\ast\)</span> is a binary function-symbol and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is a constant-symbol to be interpreted as the group identity. However, the axioms involving identity can very well be stated without using a constant-symbol: <span class="math display">\[\begin{gather}
(\exists w)((\forall x)(\exists y)(x\ast y = w \;\wedge \; y\ast x = w) \; \wedge \; (\forall x)(x\ast w = x \;\wedge w \ast x = x))
\end{gather}\]</span> Hence can have a theory <span class="math inline">\(T_g\)</span> of groups in the constant-free signature <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_g=\{\ast\}\)</span>. Constant-symbols (or any equivalent predicates) allow us to pick out a <em>specific</em> element and put arbitrarily many conditions on it. One could argue that, like for groups, it is possible to wrap the conjunction of all these sentences with an existential quantifier and get away with one less symbol in the language– but this works only if you have finitely many things to say.</p>
<p>Take the theory of groups containing an element of infinite order: the signature is <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_g\cup\{ c \}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is a constant-symbol we will use to generate the orbit. The axioms are given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{gather}
T_{g_\infty}= T_g\cup \{\neg \underbrace{c\ast (c\ast( ... \ast(}_{n+1}c))) = c \; | \; n\in \mathbb{N}\}.
\end{gather}\]</span> Taking a conjunction of all the sentences involving <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is no longer a possibility. What about multiple existential statements? The problem there is, they can all be realised by <em>different</em> elements. I can have sentences saying “there exists an element of order <span class="math inline">\(&gt;n\)</span>” for as large an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> as I want, but the group <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}\)</span> would model all of them– it has elements of arbitrarily large degree, but no element of infinite degree.</p>
<p>Suppose there were a <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_g\)</span> theory <span class="math inline">\(S\subset T_g\)</span> that did axiomatise the same class of structures as <span class="math inline">\(T_{g_\infty}\)</span>. In particular, for any <span class="math inline">\(p\in S\)</span> we must have <span class="math inline">\(T_{g_\infty}\vDash p\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(T_{g_\infty}\vdash p\)</span>. Now proofs are finite– so <span class="math inline">\(T&#39;\vDash p\)</span> holds for some finite subset <span class="math inline">\(T&#39;\subset T_{g_\infty}\)</span>. But we noticed that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}\)</span> is a model of every finite subset of <span class="math inline">\(T_{g_\infty}\)</span>, so we conclude <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}\)</span> is a model of every <span class="math inline">\(p\in S\)</span>. This is a contradiction.</p>
<p>Hence we <em>need</em> a constant-symbol (or some equivalent encoding as a predicate) to axiomatise this theory: constant-symbols are essential!</p>
