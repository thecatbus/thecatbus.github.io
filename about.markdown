I'm a mathematician in <a href="https://gla.ac.uk">Glasgow</a>, where my PhD is
supervised by <a href="https://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~mwemyss/">Michael Wemyss</a>. I am interested in homological phenomena in algebraic geometry and representation theory.

I grew up in Nashik and studied mathematics at <a href="https://cai.cam.ac.uk">Gonville & Caius College</a>, <a href="https://cam.ac.uk">Cambridge</a>. As an undergraduate I worked with <a href="https://www.dhruvrnathan.net/">Dhruv Ranganathan</a>, <a href="https://dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf">Thomas Forster</a>, and <a href="https://www.gregorywilsenach.com/">Gregory Wilsenach</a> on various projects as a part of what is now the <a href="https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/opportunities/careers-for-mathematicians/summer-research-mathematics/information-for-students">CSRIM</a> program. In addition to algebra and geometry, I have enjoyed studying functional analysis and various aspects of logic and model theory.

In Cambridge I was involved with the <a href="https://archim.org.uk">The Archimedeans</a> for all four years, serving as the President for the latter two. We organised various events and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdswONpWjfKTbpkBUP4fOyA">talks by mathematicians</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkfRrVVX-Kc">one of which</a> I was a speaker for. I have also served as the Vice President of <a href="https://camtex.soc.srcf.net">CamTeX</a> and as a graphics designer for various student societies. I am largely involved with <a href="https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/admissions/student-ambassadors">outreach</a> and had the opportunity to interview various mathematicians in 2020 and 2021 for the International Mathematics Olympiad, the recordings of which can be watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKMxEXwHQFMV-AeXzhmeFVYzjpEW5Rkuk">here</a>.

 I sometimes write <a href="https://github.com/thecatbus">software</a>, and briefly
 worked with <a href="https://twitter.com/1geek0">Nilay Kulkarni</a> as a
 back-end engineer at <a href="https://www.stoa.com/about">Stoa</a> in Bangalore. Other hobbies include art and poetry.

<hr>
 Why 'Catbus', you ask? I could be fancy and say the cat stands for
 'category', but the truth is I just like cats (and <i>My Neighbour Totoro</i>) and find it incredibly amusing
 that the catbus is a cat and a bus at the same time.

 See also: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugcat_Capoo"><i>Bugcat</i></a>, which <a href="https://yanyauc.com">Yan Yau Cheng</a> is a connoisseur of. If such animated creatures and critters interest you as much as they do us, I highly (highly) recommend <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4ZM20n-jDnfG-QrAbDh-EpcSU6veNhRC&feature=shared">Kid vampir</a>.
