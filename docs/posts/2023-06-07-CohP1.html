<p>Grothendieck proved any algebraic vector bundle on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1\)</span> splits into a direct sum of line bundles, and consequently any coherent sheaf on the variety is a direct sum of line bundles and torsion sheaves. This behaviour, and its ramifications on the derived category, exhibit how <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1\)</span> is very close to a principal ideal domain. The results above can be proven with as much or as little machinery as one desires– indeed one can take the point of view that this classification of coherent sheaves is a mere consequence of existence of Jordan normal forms of matrices. In this article however we look at a more cohomological proof, showing how Serre duality shines in these situations.</p>

<h1 id="serres-twisting-sheaves">Serre’s twisting sheaves</h1>
<p>We start with a quick recap of divisors on the projective line– recall that Serre characterises quasicoherent sheaves on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1\)</span> as coming from graded modules over the homogeneous coordinate ring <span class="math inline">\(S=k[x,y]\)</span> via a construction akin to the <span class="math inline">\(\text{Proj}\)</span> construction. Explicitly, given a graded <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-module <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, the corresponding sheaf is given on the distinguished open <span class="math inline">\(U_f\)</span> corresponding to a homogeneous element <span class="math inline">\(f\in S\)</span> by the degree <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> part of <span class="math inline">\(M\otimes_S S[\frac{1}{f}]\)</span>. Thus for instance writing <span class="math inline">\(S(n)\)</span> for the graded module given in degree <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(S_{n+k}\)</span>, we see that the corresponding sheaf <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(n)\)</span> is given on <span class="math inline">\(U_y=\mathbb{P}^1\setminus \{\infty\}\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(y^nk[\frac{x}{y}]\)</span> so that it has global sections given by degree <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> homogeneous polynomials in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. These are evidently locally free of rank <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and we have a sequence <span class="math inline">\(...\mathscr{O}(-1),\mathscr{O},\mathscr{O}(1),...\)</span> of line bundles called <em>Serre’s twisting sheaves.</em> These are so named because any sheaf <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{F}\in \text{QCoh}\mathbb{P}^1\)</span> can be twisted to obtain a new sheaf <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{F}(n)=\mathscr{F}\otimes\mathscr{O}(n)\)</span>. The notation is consistent in that the structure sheaf <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(0)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(m)\otimes \mathscr{O}(n)=\mathscr{O}(m+n)\)</span> by noting that the functor sending a graded <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-module to the corresponding sheaf of <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}\)</span>-modules is monoidal.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1\)</span> is a smooth integral variety, in particular the total quotient ring <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{K}\)</span> is the constant sheaf given by the function field (i.e. the stalk of <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}\)</span> at the generic point) <span class="math inline">\(k(x,y)\)</span>. The sheaf <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{K}\)</span> is quasicoherent, coming from the graded <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-module <span class="math inline">\(K=k[x,y]\cdot k(\frac{x}{y})\)</span> which can be seen as the subring of <span class="math inline">\(k(x,y)\)</span> containing rational functions with homogeneous denominators. Now any line bundle on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1\)</span> embeds into <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{K}\)</span> (and such embeddings are in bijection with rational sections of the bundle); and by definition a Cartier divisor is a rank <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> locally free subsheaf of <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{K}\)</span>. For instance any homogeneous element <span class="math inline">\(f\in K_n\)</span> defines an injection <span class="math inline">\(S(-n)\hookrightarrow K\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(1\mapsto f\)</span> and hence an injection <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(-n)\hookrightarrow \mathscr{K}\)</span> corresponding to the rational section <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{f}\)</span>. We write <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(-D)\)</span> for the image of this injection where <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is the divisor of zeros and poles of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>; this is consistent with the standard correspondence between Weil and Cartier divisors on a smooth variety where an effective Weil divisor <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> has ideal sheaf <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(-D)\subset \mathscr{O}\)</span> which happens to be locally free (hence a Cartier divisor.) Given a Weil divisor <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> it is rather straightforward to describe a homogeneous element <span class="math inline">\(f\in K\)</span> with zeros and poles given by <span class="math inline">\(-D\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(D)\)</span> must as a line bundle be isomorphic to the twisting sheaf <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(\text{deg}D)\)</span>. It follows that <span class="math inline">\(\{\mathscr{O}(n)\;|\; n\in \mathbb{Z}\}\)</span> are all the line bundles (up to isomorphism) on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1\)</span>, and the Picard group is isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="cohomology-and-serre-duality">Cohomology and Serre duality</h2>
<p>The functor <span class="math inline">\(H^0(\mathbb{P}^1,-)\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\text{Coh}\mathbb{P}^1\)</span> computes global sections of a coherent sheaf, equivalently <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}\)</span>-module homomorphisms from <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}\)</span> into the sheaf. Examining the description of the line bundles above, we see that the dimension <span class="math inline">\(h^0(\mathbb{P}^1,\mathscr{O}(n))\)</span> is then the number of degree <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> monomials in <span class="math inline">\(k[x,y]\)</span>.</p>
<p>What about other cohomology groups? While it is easy to explicitly calculate them using a Cech cover, this is a good place to state the Serre duality theorem which we extensively use in what follows. Recall the <em>canonical bundle</em> <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1\)</span> is in this case the contangent bundle (it is the determinant of the cotangent bundle general projective varieties), hence it sits in the Euler exact sequence <span class="math display">\[0\to \omega \to \mathscr{O}(-1)^{\oplus 2}\to \mathscr{O}\to 0.\]</span> Taking determinants, we must have <span class="math inline">\(\omega \otimes \mathscr{O} = \text{det}(\mathscr{O}(-1)^{\oplus 2}) = (\mathscr{O}(-1))^{\otimes 2}\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\omega = \mathscr{O}(-2)\)</span> (there are easier ways to see this!)</p>
<p>The <em>Serre duality theorem</em> for smooth projective varieties of dimension <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> states that for any locally free coherent sheaves <span class="math inline">\(F,G\)</span> there are isomorphisms <span class="math inline">\(\text{Ext}^i(F,G) \cong \text{Ext}^{n-i}(G,F\otimes \omega )^{\check{}}\)</span>. In the case of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1\)</span>, this firstly shows that <span class="math inline">\(H^i(\mathbb{P}^1,F)=\text{Ext}^i(\mathscr{O},F)=\text{Ext}^{1-i}(F, \omega)^{\check{}}\)</span> vanishes if <span class="math inline">\(i&lt;0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(i&gt;1\)</span>, and moreover we have <span class="math inline">\(H^1(\mathbb{P}^1, F)=\text{Ext}^0(\mathscr{O},F\otimes\omega)^{\check{}}=H^0(F^{\check{}}(-2))^{\check{}}\)</span> whenever <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is locally free. Thus for the line bundles <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(n)\)</span>, the cohomology groups look like <span class="math display">\[h^i(\mathbb{P}^1, \mathscr{O}(n))= \begin{cases}
n+1, &amp; i=0, \quad n\geq 0\\
-n+1, &amp; i=1, \quad n\leq -1 \\
0, &amp;\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}.\]</span></p>
<h1 id="a-series-of-decompositions">A series of decompositions</h1>
<p>Equipped with an understanding of line bundles, we can now set off to prove our main theorem on the structure of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{D}^b(\text{Coh}\mathbb{P}^1)\)</span>, showing that the derived category of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1\)</span> behaves very similarly to that of a point.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><sc>Theorem</sc> The only indecomposable objects in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{D}^b(\text{Coh}\mathbb{P}^1)\)</span> are shifts of <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(n)\)</span> and skyscrapers, and every object in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{D}^b(\text{Coh}\mathbb{P}^1)\)</span> is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of indecomposables.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Note the theorem does not say all skyscrapers are indecomposable, rather it says any indecomposable that is not (up to shift) a line bundle must be a skyscraper.</em></p>
<p>Thus everything splits into line bundles and skyscrapers. The proof will go in a sequence of splitting results– we will first show that any complex in the derived category is a direct sum of its cohomology sheaves (which are simply coherent sheaves), and any coherent sheaf is the direct sum of a vector bundle and some skyscrapers (these results hold more generally for all smooth curves and will be proven in that generality). Finally, we prove Grothendieck’s theorem that all vector bundles on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1\)</span> split into line bundles thus completing the proof.</p>
<p>A reader not interested in derived categories can skip the next section and still walk away with an understanding of <span class="math inline">\(\text{Coh}\mathbb{P}^1\)</span>; indeed the reduction from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{D}^b(\text{Coh}\mathbb{P}^1)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\text{Coh}\mathbb{P}^1\)</span> is formal homological algebra and the interesting geometric arguments happen after this reduction.</p>
<h2 id="small-dimension-miracles">Small dimension miracles</h2>
<p>Recall that the <em>homological dimension</em> of an Abelian category <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{A}\)</span> is the smallest integer <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\text{Ext}^i(F,G)=0\)</span> whenever <span class="math inline">\(F,G\in \mathscr{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(i&gt;d\)</span>. By our discussion above it is clear that the category of coherent sheaves on a smooth curve has homological dimension <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, more generally the same Serre duality argument shows <span class="math inline">\(\text{Coh}X\)</span> has homological dimension <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> whenever <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a smooth projective variety of dimension <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. In small homological dimensions, everything in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{D}^b(\mathscr{A})\)</span> splits into a direct sum of its cohomologies.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<sc>Theorem</sc> [Huy, cor 3.15] If <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{A}\)</span> has homological dimension <span class="math inline">\(\leq 1\)</span>, then any object of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{D}^b(\mathscr{A})\)</span> is isomorphic to a direct sum <span class="math inline">\(\bigoplus A_i[i]\)</span> where the <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> are objects in <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{A}\)</span>.
<div class="proof">
<p><sc>Proof</sc> We induct on the length of the complex <span class="math inline">\(A_\bullet\)</span>, clear if it is acyclic (i.e. has length <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> up to quasi-isomorphism). If the complex is acyclic, we can up to shift assume <span class="math inline">\(A_0=H^0(A_\bullet)\neq 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H^i(A_\bullet)=0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i&lt;0\)</span>. Then there is an exact triangle of the form <span class="math display">\[A_0 \to A_\bullet \to A&#39;_\bullet \to A_0[1]\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A&#39;_\bullet\)</span> is supported in degrees <span class="math inline">\(&gt;0\)</span>. It suffices to show this triangle splits, which we do by showing <span class="math inline">\(\text{Hom}(A&#39;_\bullet, A_0[1])=0\)</span>. By induction hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(A&#39;_\bullet = \bigoplus_{i&lt;0}A_i[i]\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(A_i\in \mathscr{A}\)</span> (remember <span class="math inline">\(A[-1]\)</span> is concentrated in degree <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>), so that <span class="math inline">\(\text{Hom}(A&#39;_\bullet, A_0[1])=\bigoplus_{i&lt;0}\text{Hom}(A_i[i], A_0[1])\)</span> which is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\bigoplus_{i&lt;0}\text{Ext}^{1-i}(A_i,A_0)\)</span> and hence vanishes by the assumption on homological dimension. <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Thus we have our first splitting result on the level of derived categories, and the problem has been reduced to understanding the underlying Abelian category.</p>
<h2 id="the-standard-torsion-pair">The standard torsion pair</h2>
<p>We say a quasicoherent sheaf <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> on an integral scheme <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is <em>torsion</em> if its stalk at the generic point vanishes. Given a quasicoherent sheaf <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> we can define a subsheaf <span class="math inline">\(T\subset E\)</span> as the union of all torsion subsheaves; this is torsion since taking stalk commutes with taking unions (one way to see this– the stalk is defined as a pullback, and the pullback functor is a left adjoint so preserves colimits) and we call <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> the <em>torsion part</em> of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<sc>Lemma</sc> The construction of the torsion part is stalk-local, i.e. at any point <span class="math inline">\(p\in X\)</span> the <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}_p\)</span> module <span class="math inline">\(T_p\)</span> is the torsion part of <span class="math inline">\(E_p\)</span>.
<div class="proof">
<p><sc>Proof</sc> Suppose <span class="math inline">\(f_p\in \mathscr{O}_p\setminus 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_p\in \mathscr{E}_p\)</span> are such that <span class="math inline">\(f_p\cdot t_p =0\)</span>, we want to show <span class="math inline">\(t_p\in T_p\)</span>. Extend <span class="math inline">\(f_p,t_p\)</span> to sections <span class="math inline">\(f\in A\setminus 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t\in E(U)\)</span> respectively over some affine open neighbourhood <span class="math inline">\(\text{Spec }A=U\ni p\)</span>; now take the subsheaf <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}_U t\subset E|_U\)</span> (coming from the submodule <span class="math inline">\(A t\subset E(U)\)</span>) and push it forward along the inclusion <span class="math inline">\(i:U\hookrightarrow X\)</span> to a subsheaf <span class="math inline">\(i_\ast\, \mathscr{O}_Ut \subset i_\ast E|_U \subset E\)</span>. The sheaf <span class="math inline">\(i_\ast\, \mathscr{O}_Ut\)</span> is torsion since its stalk at the generic point is the localisation <span class="math inline">\((A t)_{(0)}=(A_pt_p)_{(0)}=0\)</span>, hence it follows that <span class="math inline">\(i_\ast \mathscr{O}_U t\subset T\)</span>. Take stalks at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> to conclude. <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Consequently, all stalks of the quotient <span class="math inline">\(F=E/T\)</span> are torsion-free and we say <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a <em>torsion-free</em> sheaf. Both the full subcategories <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{T}=\{T\in \text{Coh}X\;|\; T\text{ is torsion}\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{F}=\{F\in \text{Coh}X\;|\; F\text{ is torsion-free}\}\)</span> are additive, and any <span class="math inline">\(E\in \text{Coh}X\)</span> can be uniquely expressed as the extension of a torsion-free sheaf by a torsion sheaf. Moreover, if <span class="math inline">\(T\in \mathfrak{T}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F\in \mathfrak{F}\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(\text{Hom}(T,F)=0\)</span> (since such a map must be zero on stalks) and thus <span class="math inline">\((\mathfrak{T}, \mathfrak{F})\)</span> form a <em>torsion pair</em> on <span class="math inline">\(\text{Coh}X\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a smooth algebraic curve we can say more– our second splitting result!</p>
<div class="theorem">
<sc>Theorem</sc> Every coherent sheaf on a smooth algebraic curve can be expressed as the direct sum of a vector bundle and a torsion sheaf.
<div class="proof">
<p><sc>Proof</sc> We examine the two components of the standard torsion pair on <span class="math inline">\(\text{Coh}X\)</span>. Note each stalk <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}_p\)</span> is a discrete valuation ring (in particular a PID) so that torsion-free <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}_p\)</span>-modules are in fact free. Thus a coherent sheaf on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is torsion-free if and only if it is locally free i.e. an algebraic vector bundle.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a torsion sheaf, by definition support is a closed subset not equal to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> so <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is supported on a finite set of closed points. Hence we can write <span class="math inline">\(T=\bigoplus_{p\in X}T_p\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(T_p\)</span> is the skyscraper at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> taking value equal to the stalk <span class="math inline">\(T_p\)</span>. In particular, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a finite direct sum of flasque sheaves. Whenever <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is locally free of rank <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, this allows us to compute <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    \text{Ext}^1(F,T)&amp;=\text{Ext}^1(\mathscr{O}, F^{\check{}}\otimes T) \\
    &amp;=\text{H}^1(X,F^{\check{}} \otimes T) \\
    &amp;= \bigoplus_{p\in X}\text{H}^1(X,T_p^{\oplus n}) \\
    &amp;= 0.
\end{align*}\]</span> Thus any sequence <span class="math inline">\(0\to T\to E \to F \to 0\)</span> must split (possibly non-canonically) and the result follows. <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="the-splitting-of-vector-bundles-or-grothendiecks-theorem">The splitting of vector bundles, or Grothendieck’s theorem</h2>
<p>On a general curve this is the furthest we can go without invoking more sophisticated technology, indeed (stable, in particular indecomposable) vector bundles of a fixed rank on curves of positive genus form moduli. However the genus zero case is particularly nice– we will show that the only indecomposable vector bundles have rank <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and every vector bundle splits as a direct sum of line bundles. This was first proved by Grothendieck in 1957 [Gro], and can be proven using very elementary techniques by considering Jordan normal forms of transition matrices as in [Haz]. We take the approach suggested in exercise V.2.6 of [Har], by considering invertible subsheaves and trying to split the inclusion. Section 18.5.5 of [Vak] walks the reader through this proof by breaking it down into a sequence of exercises, but still uses transition matrices to show the splitting– we avoid this by simply using more homological algebra.</p>
<p>The following lemma is a useful characterisation of when invertible subsheaves of a certain degree exist.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<sc>Lemma</sc> For a torsion-free coherent sheaf <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(h^0(\mathbb{P}^1, F(k))&gt;0\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(-k)\)</span> injects into <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>.
<div class="proof">
<p>An injection <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(-k)\hookrightarrow F\)</span> can be twisted to get an injection <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}\hookrightarrow F(k)\)</span>, which corresponds to a non-zero element of <span class="math inline">\(H^0(\mathbb{P}^1, F(k))\)</span>. Conversely if <span class="math inline">\(h^0(\mathbb{P}^1, F(k))&gt;0\)</span> then choosing a non-zero global section of <span class="math inline">\(F(k)\)</span> gives a non-zero map <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}\to F(k)\)</span>. Claim such a map must be injective– the kernel of the map is a proper submodule of <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}\)</span>, i.e. an ideal sheaf for some non-empty closed subscheme <span class="math inline">\(Z\subset \mathbb{P}^1\)</span>. Thus the image of the map is the structure sheaf of <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> (pushed forward to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1\)</span> along the inclusion) but <span class="math inline">\(F(k)\)</span> is torsion-free so all its subsheaves (in particular the image of the map) is torsion-free. This is possible only if <span class="math inline">\(Z=\mathbb{P}^1\)</span>, i.e. the kernel was trivial. Then twisting the injection <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}\hookrightarrow F(k)\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(-k)\)</span> proves the lemma. <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We can now prove the main result– the key idea is that quotienting a locally free sheaf by an invertible subsheaf of maximal degree necessarily leaves you with something locally free.</p>
<div class="theorem">

Thus <span class="math inline">\(m_i&lt;0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, while <span class="math inline">\(n_i&lt;0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i&lt;r\)</span>. Computing global sections then gives a contradiction.</p>
<p>Thus it suffices to show every vector bundle splits as a direct sum of line bundles since the factors can always be reordered to satisfy the theorem. We induct on the rank <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and note that the case <span class="math inline">\(r=1\)</span> is simply the computation of the Picard group. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> has rank <span class="math inline">\(r\geq 2\)</span>, and consider <span class="math display">\[\{k\;|\; \mathscr{O}(k) \text{ injects into }F\} \subset \mathbb{Z}.\]</span> By ampleness of <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(1)\)</span>, the set is non-empty. On the other hand an injection <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(k)\to F\)</span> induces an injection of global sections, so the set must be bounded above (since <span class="math inline">\(h^0(\mathbb{P}^1, \mathscr{O}(k))\to \infty\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(k\to \infty\)</span>). Thus the set has a maximum element <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Choose an injection <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(n)\to F\)</span> with image <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, claim the cokernel <span class="math inline">\(F&#39;\)</span> is torsion-free; to see this note that it surjects onto its torsion-free part <span class="math inline">\(F&#39;&#39;\)</span> and we have a composite surjection <span class="math inline">\(F\twoheadrightarrow F&#39;&#39;\)</span> of locally free sheaves. The kernel <span class="math inline">\(L&#39;\)</span> of this is a subsheaf of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> so is necessarily torsion-free, moreover <span class="math inline">\(F&quot;\)</span> has rank <span class="math inline">\(r-1\)</span> (since <span class="math inline">\(F&#39;\)</span> is locally free of rank <span class="math inline">\(r-1\)</span> on the complement of finitely many points) so the <span class="math inline">\(L&#39;\)</span> is a line bundle <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(N)\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Thus <span class="math inline">\(F/L\)</span> surjects onto <span class="math inline">\(F/L&#39;\)</span>, so we must have <span class="math inline">\(L\subset L&#39; \subset F\)</span> i.e. there is a sequence of injections <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(n)\hookrightarrow \mathscr{O}(N)\hookrightarrow F\)</span>. But the first injection necessarily implies <span class="math inline">\(N\geq n\)</span> (by considering global sections after twisting if necessary), and equality holds by choice of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Thus <span class="math inline">\(F&#39;=F&#39;&#39;\)</span> is torsion-free of rank <span class="math inline">\(r-1\)</span>.</p>
<p>By induction hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(F&#39;=\bigoplus_{i=1}^{r-1}\mathscr{O}(n_i)\)</span> is a sum of line bundles, and moreover <span class="math inline">\(n\geq n_i\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>: to see this, note that applying <span class="math inline">\(\text{Hom}(\mathscr{O}(n+1),-)\)</span> to the exact sequence <span class="math inline">\(0\to \mathscr{O}(n)\to F\to F&#39;\to 0\)</span> gives a long exact sequence <span class="math display">\[\cdots \to \text{Hom}(\mathscr{O}(n+1), F) \to \text{Hom}(\mathscr{O}(n+1), F&#39;) \to \text{Ext}^1(\mathscr{O}(n+1),\mathscr{O}(n)) \to \cdots.\]</span> Now the first term vanishes because any homomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(k)\to F\)</span> is necessarily injective and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> was maximal to admit such an injection. The last term vanishes because <span class="math inline">\(\text{Ext}^1(\mathscr{O}(n+1), \mathscr{O}(n))= H^1(\mathscr{O}(-1))=0\)</span>. Thus <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(n+1)\)</span> does not inject into <span class="math inline">\(F&#39;\)</span>, which is possible only if each <span class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span> is strictly smaller than <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>.</p>
<p>It remains to show <span class="math inline">\(0\to \mathscr{O}(n)\to F\to F&#39; \to 0\)</span> splits, we do this by computing <span class="math inline">\(\text{Ext}^1(F&#39;, \mathscr{O}(n))\)</span> and showing it vanishes. By Serre duality it suffices to show <span class="math inline">\(\text{Hom}(\mathscr{O}, F&#39;^{\check{}}\otimes \mathscr{O}(n)\otimes \omega)=H^0(F&#39;^\check{}(n-2))\)</span> vanishes. But this is clear, since <span class="math inline">\(F&#39;^{\check{}}(n-2) = \bigoplus_{i=1}^{r-1}\mathscr{O}(n-n_i-2)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n-n_i-2&lt;0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></p>

<p>This finishes the proof of the main result.</p>
<h1 id="full-exceptional-collections">Full exceptional collections</h1>
<p>We have seen how the entire derived category of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1\)</span> can be built using skyscrapers and line bundles, if one is allowed to take shifts and direct sums. The definition of a triangulated category comes with more operations– if one also allows taking cones of morphisms, then the entire category can be generated by just two line bundles! Indeed, any skyscraper at a point <span class="math inline">\(i:P\hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^1\)</span> can be built as an iterated self-extension of the structure sheaf <span class="math inline">\(i\ast\mathscr{O}|_P\)</span>, which itself sits in an exact sequence <span class="math display">\[0\to \mathscr{O}(-1)\to \mathscr{O}\to i_\ast \mathscr{O}|_P\to 0.\]</span> Likewise, the Euler sequence shows <span class="math inline">\(\omega=\mathscr{O}(-2)\)</span> is an extension of <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(-1)^{\oplus 2}\)</span>, and taking twists of the Euler sequence we can build any <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(n)\)</span> as an extension of shifts of summands of <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{O}(-1)\)</span>; in other words the collection <span class="math inline">\(\{\mathscr{O},\mathscr{O}(-1)\}\)</span> is <em>full</em>.</p>
<p>Moreover, writing <span class="math inline">\(E_0=\mathscr{O}(-1), E_1=\mathscr{O}\)</span> our cohomology calculation shows <span class="math display">\[\text{ext}^n(E_i, E_j)=\begin{cases} 1, &amp;n=0,
\quad i=j \\ 0, &amp;i&gt;j \text{ or } n\neq 0, i=j
\end{cases}.\]</span> Such sequences in a triangulated category are <em>exceptional</em>, and full exceptional collections in a triangulated category are akin to a basis for a vector spaces.</p>
<p>Both the statements above remains true up to twists, giving us the following.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><sc>Theorem</sc> <span class="math inline">\(\{\mathscr{O}(n),\mathscr{O}(n+1)\}\)</span> is a full exceptional collection in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{D}^b\text{Coh}\mathbb{P}^1\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>An analogous statement holds for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^n\)</span>, and is a consequence of Beilinson’s theorem (see <a href="../documents/2022-part-iii-essay.pdf">my part III essay</a>.)</p>
