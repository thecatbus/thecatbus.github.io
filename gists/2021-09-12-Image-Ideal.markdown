_The image of an ideal is an ideal of the image_. 

If $\phi: A\rightarrow B$ is a ring homomorphism and $J\subset A$ is an ideal then $\phi(A)$ is a subring of $B$ and $\phi(J)$ is an ideal of this subring: for any $a,b\in J$ and $t\in A$, we have $\phi(a)+\phi(t)\cdot \phi(b)=\phi(a+tb)\in \phi(J)$. In particular, surjectivity is sufficient for the image of an ideal to be an ideal.
