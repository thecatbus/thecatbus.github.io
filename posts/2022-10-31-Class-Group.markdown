<div class="teaser">
Cohomology is often described as measuring obstruction to triviality of some sort-- but building up to this intuition takes time and a lot of examples. Here we sketch three scenarios arising naturally in algebraic geometry and topology, and show how studying these might naturally lead one to the Čech complex.

# The Mittag-Leffler and Cousin Problems 
In its simplest variant the Mittag-Leffler problem asks if, given a discrete set of points $P_i\in \mathbb{C}$ and corresponding natural numbers $n_i >0$, there exists a meromorphic function on $\mathbb{C}$ which has poles of order $n_i$ at $P_i$ and is holomorphic elsewhere. Clearly the problem is locally trivial, and the difficulty lies in 'patching together' local solutions.

We propose a generalisation of the Mittag-Leffler problem -- given an integral scheme $X$ with field of rational functions $K(X)$, say the rational functions $f$ and $g$ have the same _principal parts_ on an open set $U$ if $f-g\in \mathscr{O}_X(U)$. Then a _Cousin data_ on $X$ consists of an open cover $X=\bigcup_i U_i$ and rational functions $f_i\in K(X)$ for each $U_i$, such that $f_i$ and $f_j$ have the same principal parts on $U_i\cap U_j$.
