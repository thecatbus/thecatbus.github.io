As I pack and bid adieu
my mind drifts back three hundred days--
I walked in with an empty suitcase
of clothes and dreams, old and new.

Thirty square-feet of a clean slate
awaited another year of life, 
and now it awaits the judgement 
of what's been written till the date.

And on it I see written names of drinks 
I had when I was with friends
and the silent echoes of the thoughts
only a man who is alone thinks.

I see colour that never became art,
a book that was never read
and I think of all I didn't do
and I see a trampoline and a shopping cart.

A garden of butterflies and foxes
a slate too fancy for my writing,
and as I clean it off I see my life--
a life in three large boxes.
